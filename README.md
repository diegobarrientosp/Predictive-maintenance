# Predictive Maintenance with Machine Learning

This repository showcases my learning journey in applying **machine learning techniques** to **predictive maintenance** problems in industrial settings, particularly in the context of **chemical engineering**. The project uses synthetic data to simulate operational conditions for a centrifugal pump and explores various models to classify its status as either normal or at risk of failure.

## Objectives
- Learn and apply machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **Random Forest** to solve predictive maintenance problems.
- Understand the trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy, and interpretability in industrial applications.
- Gain deeper insights into how machine learning can be leveraged to optimize operations in chemical engineering and related fields.

## Repository Structure
- `notebook/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with all code and analysis.
  - **`predictive maintenance.ipynb`**: The main notebook where models are trained, evaluated, and compared.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and its objectives.

## My Learning Goals
This project is part of my effort to expand my knowledge in **machine learning** and its applications in **industrial operations**, particularly in predictive maintenance for chemical engineering processes.
